# Rollie Rollie (Rollie NoWaste)
Rollie NoWaste is an elaborate waste management system that uses two main concepts to solve the problem of segregating waste:

### 1. AI based garbage classifier 
We use AI image recognition software to categorically segregate the waste.

### 2. Community-Plant Management Software 
Waste is systematically transported to the recycling plants where they get flagged if consistent unsegregated waste is found and the said communities are fined for their inability to segregate waste properly.

This educates the public and raises social awareness about recycling waste which results in lesser mixing of unlike garbage.
